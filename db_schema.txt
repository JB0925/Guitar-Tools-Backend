My app, Guitar Tools, is primarily a utility app, centered around various practice tools that a guitarist could use. They include:

1). An interactive flashcard game, where the user can click record, find the note on the flash card and play it before the card disappears, and then be given feedback as to whether or not they were correct. 

2). A metronome that the user can manipulate in browser in multiple ways. The user can also use a toggle switch to go back and forth between 4/4 and 6/8 time signatures while practicing.

3). A guitar tuner to, well...tune their guitar. :)

4). A "famous guitarists" section that utilizes an existing API for data (photos, bio, etc.) about a guitarist or musician that they choose.

As such, not much is needed in the way of a database for this project. I have one schema set up. This is the "users" schema. It is used to hold login information (username and password), as well as a "high_score" column. This column refers to the flashcard game mentioned above. Any user can use any utility, but if they are logged in and playing the flash card game, we keep track of their all time high score. If they break that score, we let them know in browser and update their information in the database.

My schema for the "users" table is:
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
   username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL
   password VARCHAR NOT NULL
